# Modded characters and their mod

Titan Quest keeps custom map (mod) characters in `SaveData\User\_<name>`, apart from the main campaign ones in
`SaveData\Main`, but nothing in their save files names the mod they were played with. TQVault lists both kinds of
characters together and loads each one with its own mod's data, in the same session.

## The link file

The character menu (the tools button of the character list) has a *Mod link...* entry for custom map characters. The
dialog lists the installed mods (legacy custom maps in `My Games\Titan Quest - Immortal Throne\CustomMaps` and Steam
Workshop items) and links the character to one, or removes its link. The choice is kept in the character's save folder:

`SaveData\User\_<name>\TQVaultAE.ModLink.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "mod": "shadowchampions",
  "folder": "e:\\games\\steam\\steamapps\\workshop\\content\\475150\\1949340853\\shadowchampions",
  "linkedUtc": "2026-11-09T00:12:53.1422315Z"
}
```

- `mod` is the mod's folder name: the game names the mod's database (`database\<mod>.arz`) and its shared stash folder
  (`SaveData\Sys\<mod>`) after it, so it finds the mod again when it moved (another Steam library, another computer).
- `folder` is where the mod was when linked, preferred while it exists.
- The game never writes a file with this name; it is copied with the character (*Duplicate*, archive).

## Suggest

*Suggest* reads the record ids that `Player.chr` and the character's `winsys.dxb` use, keeps those the base game
database does not have, and selects the installed mod whose database has the most of them. It never links: the user
clicks *Link*. A character that only uses base game records (a new one, or one without mod items) cannot be told
apart: the dialog says so.

## Which data a character is loaded with

| Character | Data |
|---|---|
| Main campaign (`SaveData\Main`) | the base game |
| Custom map, linked to an installed mod | that mod |
| Custom map, not linked, or linked to a mod not installed | the custom map of the command line (`/mod:`), else the one chosen in the settings when mods are enabled, else the base game |

Selecting a character makes its map the active one: its database and archives, and its shared stash files
(`SaveData\Sys\<mod>\winsys.dxb` and `miscsys.dxb`, or `SaveData\Sys\` for the base game). Each map's database is read
the first time it is needed (about half a second for a large mod) and kept for the session, so switching back is
immediate. A character read with another map's database (before it was linked) is read again, unless it has unsaved
changes.

*Load all files* at startup only reads the characters of the startup map; the others are read when selected.
