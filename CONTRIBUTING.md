## Prerequisite
This project use DDS to PNG conversion from nuget [Magick.NET-Q8-AnyCPU](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) so you need to install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#gsc.tab=0) to resolve DLL during build.<br/>
The simple way to do that is to use command `winget install ImageMagick.Q8` before opening the solution.

## Game file formats
Working on the game file readers (`src/TQVaultAE.GameFiles`, used by `src/TQVaultAE.Data` and `src/TQVaultAE.DbCli`)? The `.arc`, `.arz`, text and `.tex` formats, the known pitfalls and the item stat randomization are documented in [Titan Quest Game File Formats](documentation/tq-file-formats.md).

## Driving the app from an AI agent
Debug builds start an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server inside TQVault, at `http://127.0.0.1:47017/mcp` (loopback only). It lets an AI agent such as Claude Code check UI changes on the running app without screenshots:
- read windows, vaults, characters and the items in each panel;
- answer dialogs;
- drag items through the panels' own code;
- capture a panel to PNG.

The repository's `.mcp.json` registers it as `tqvault`: start the Debug build, then open Claude Code at the repository root. While automation drives the app, a save guard blocks every write to your saves. Release builds contain none of this. See [Automation endpoint](documentation/AUTOMATION.md).

## Style and format
TQVaultAE follows the standard C# format and import order. Refrain from submitting white-space changes mixed-in with your functional changes. 
**N.B.**: Braces are mandatory.
